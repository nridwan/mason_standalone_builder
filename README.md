# Mason Standalone Builder

## About
This repository contains standalone builder for [mason](https://github.com/felangel/mason) template builder, created for personal purpose just in case people need to use this tool without using dart.
Will update periodically (I hope so) or just remind me whenever there's a version update.

## Requirement
Have Dart / Flutter installed

## How to Build
1. run clone.ps1 / clone.sh
2. run compile.ps1 / compile.sh

## Output
see in releases/OS_NAME/mason(.exe if windows)

move the executable somewhere and add to path.

note: OS_NAME only windows/linux, mac output in linux directory.

## Todo
- automate add to path but still not sure when.
